# Analog Clock App Interview Problem
You will create an algorithm to position the second, minute, and hour hand of a clock. /
Don't worry if you are not familiar with React, this problem does not test React knowledge. /
You will implement the algorithm to find the clock hand positions in degrees in the file located at src/ComputeAngles.js/

# Getting Started
1. In your terminal from the analog-clock-app-problem directory, run ```npm install```
    If you have not installed npm before, we will go through that together
2. After install is complete, run ```npm start```
    This will launch the app on a development server.
3. In a web browser, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app running.
    Leave this running while writing code and you can see how your updates affect the app.
